This page highlights projects that represent what I want to be known for: **digital chip design**, **verification**, and **practical use of Generative AI** in engineering workflows.

## Featured

### SaxoFlow — Open-source design + verification suite (AI-assisted)
*Aug 2025–present · Personal / open-source*

SaxoFlow is a student-focused initiative to make digital design and verification easier to learn and faster to iterate. It combines open-source EDA tools with AI-assisted workflows to reduce setup friction and repetitive work.

**What exists today**
- Interactive CLI to install and manage open-source EDA tools
- Agents that support RTL design, testbench-based verification, and formal verification
- An AI copilot mode to help users navigate flows and debug issues

**What I’m building next**
- Retrieval-based help (RAG) grounded in docs/specs/project context
- A lightweight IDE experience so students can use the flow without living in the terminal

### RISC-V Processor “Kreacher” — RTL design + SoC integration
*Oct 2024–present · Team project · SystemVerilog*

A collaborative RISC-V ISA-based processor integrated into a System-on-Chip environment, with emphasis on correctness and integration readiness.

**My contributions**
- Implemented datapath modules including the **ALU** and its **decoder**
- Focused on functional accuracy and clean integration into the SoC environment

*Note: code is not public.*

## Additional technical projects

### Neural Processing Unit blocks — BatchNorm + Softmax processing elements
*Feb 2024–Aug 2024 · SystemVerilog / Vivado*

Designed configurable processing elements and supporting control/memory components for Batch Normalization and Softmax in an SoC-style architecture.

**What I built**
- Configurable compute blocks, memory + control units, and integration logic
- Post-implementation functional simulation and timing simulation

**Outcome**
- Exceeded state-of-the-art benchmarks in performance and resource utilization in Vivado

### Physical design optimization — Carry-save array multiplier
*Apr 2023–Jul 2023 · Cadence Virtuoso / Genus / Innovus*

Optimized the physical design of a carry-save array multiplier with a practical PPA focus.

**Outcome**
- Reduced area by **~60%** and improved performance by **~4×** through floorplanning and placement strategies
