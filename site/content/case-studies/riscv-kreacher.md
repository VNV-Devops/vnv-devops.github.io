## Abstract
A collaborative RISC-V ISA-based processor integrated into a System-on-Chip environment, with emphasis on correctness and integration readiness.

## Problem
SoC integration requires stable interfaces, clean datapaths, and disciplined verification at block boundaries.

## Approach
- Implemented datapath modules including ALU and decoder
- Focused on functional accuracy and integration quality

## Evidence
- Team project outcomes and integration deliverables (code not public)

## Stack
SystemVerilog, RTL integration workflow
