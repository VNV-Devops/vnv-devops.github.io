## Abstract
SaxoFlow is a student-focused initiative that combines open-source EDA tools with GenAI-assisted workflows to reduce setup friction and repetitive verification work.

## Problem
Learning and iterating on digital design and verification is slowed down by environment setup, tool fragmentation, and repeated manual loops.

## Approach
- CLI-driven tool installation and flow orchestration
- Agent-assisted RTL/testbench/property generation
- Evidence-first workflow: artifacts, reproducibility, iteration logs

## Evidence
- Working CLI + initial agent workflows
- Ongoing roadmap: retrieval-grounded assistance and lightweight IDE experience

## Stack
SystemVerilog, Python, open-source EDA ecosystem
