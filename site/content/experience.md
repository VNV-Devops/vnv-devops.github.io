{{< abstract kicker="Implement (roles, ownership, outcomes)" >}}
I care about **verification quality** and **repeatable engineering workflows**.  
These roles summarize what I owned, what I shipped, and the kind of problems I’m trusted with.

## Roles

{{< artifact_card
  title="Infineon Technologies (Dresden, Germany) — Digital Functional Verification Intern"
  meta="Oct 2024–present"
  tags="Formal,UVM,Automation,GenAI,SystemVerilog,Python"
>}}
**What I did**
- Researched AI/ML approaches to improve digital verification workflows
- Built a Python-based automation framework for RTL design, testbench generation, and formal property verification (agentic AI)
- Executed formal verification on representative blocks (e.g., floating-point adder, FIFO) and functional verification of an ALU using UVM

**What I optimize for**
- Proof-oriented thinking, coverage discipline, and debugging clarity
- Workflows that produce **evidence** (artifacts and results), not just demos
