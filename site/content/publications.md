### Hey AI, Generate Me a Hardware Code! Agentic AI-based Hardware Design & Verification  
**Conference paper (IEEE / SBCCI)** · *31 Oct 2025*  

An agent-based approach to hardware design and verification that combines AI agents with human-in-the-loop iteration to converge toward working verification flows.

**Key contributions**
- An iterative agentic workflow that self-corrects and improves over multiple passes
- Evaluation across open-source designs with strong coverage results
- Emphasis on usability and configurability, not just a one-off demo

### Formal that "Floats" High: Formal Verification of Floating Point Arithmetic  
**To appear (IEEE ICM 2025)** · *14–17 Dec 2025* · Cairo, Egypt  
**Preprint:** *7 Dec 2025*  

A scalable approach to floating-point verification using direct RTL-to-RTL model checking against a golden reference, supported by staged helper assertions and counterexample-guided refinement.

**Key contributions**
- Direct RTL-to-RTL checking to reduce abstraction gaps and translation overhead
- Divide-and-conquer proof structure with modular stages and helper lemmas
- AI-assisted property generation with human refinement, plus coverage-driven analysis

### Thermal Alarm Handling in Safety Critical ECUs for Automated Vehicle Using AI and Machine Learning  
**SAE Technical Paper** · *5 Oct 2022*  

Improving thermal monitoring robustness in safety-critical ECUs by incorporating real-world use-cases that are often missed during design-time validation, with a focus on reducing false triggering and validation cost.

**Key contributions**
- Highlights gaps between lab validation and real-world thermal events
- Motivates stronger characterization and scenario coverage for robust monitoring
- Practical impact: fewer false warnings and reduced validation/warranty cost
