{{< abstract kicker="Spec (who I am and what I build)" >}}
I’m **Vaisakh Naduvodi Viswambharan**, a Master’s student in **Nanoelectronic Systems at TU Dresden**.  
My focus is **digital IC design and verification**, and I build **GenAI-assisted tooling** to make verification workflows faster, more systematic, and easier to scale—without losing rigor.

## What I’m working on now

My thesis explores how AI can help turn design intent into reliable verification results with less manual iteration. In parallel, I’m building **SaxoFlow**, a student-focused initiative combining **AI-assisted workflows** with **open-source EDA tools**.

If you want the most representative snapshot, start here:

- **Floating-point formal case study:** /case-studies/floating-point-formal/

## How I got here

I started at Bosch working on hardware validation for a chipset used in a **Bosch Electronic Power Steering ECU**. That experience gave me a “black box” moment: I could validate behavior, but I wanted to understand what was happening inside the chip and why. That curiosity pulled me deeper into IC design and verification.

In parallel, I developed an interest in AI. Over time it became clear that AI can reduce repetitive work and speed up how engineers move from an idea to **trustworthy evidence**.

## Short timeline

- **TU Dresden (Oct 2022–present):** Master’s program in Nanoelectronic Systems
- **Infineon (Oct 2024–present):** Digital Functional Verification Intern
- **Fraunhofer (Mar 2023–Sep 2024):** Student Research Assistant
- **Bosch (Jan 2018–Jul 2022):** Senior Hardware Engineer

## Highlights

- **Innovation Award 2025 (Infineon)** — Software and AI Solutions
- **Innovation Award 2020 (Bosch)** — IoT-based Driver Monitoring
- Publications: **one IEEE paper published**, one completed conference paper (planned IEEE publication), and one **DVCon US** accepted paper as a coauthor

## What I’m aiming for next

Over the next 9 months, my first preference is a **PhD** in GenAI for digital design and verification in the USA or Germany. If that does not align, I’m looking for full-time roles in digital design and verification where I can apply GenAI to real workflows.
