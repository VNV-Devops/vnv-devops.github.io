I’m **Vaisakh Naduvodi Viswambharan**, a Master’s student in **Nanoelectronic Systems at TU Dresden**. My focus is **digital IC design and verification**, and I’m particularly interested in applying **Generative AI** to make verification and engineering workflows faster, more systematic, and easier to scale.

If you want a quick overview, start with **Projects**. If you want the academic record, go to **Publications**.

### What I’m working on now

My thesis explores how AI can help turn design intent into reliable verification results with less manual iteration. In parallel, I’m building **SaxoFlow**, a student-focused initiative that combines **AI-assisted workflows** with **open-source EDA tools** to make learning and prototyping in digital design and verification more accessible.

### How I got here

I started at Bosch working on real hardware validation for a chipset used in a **Bosch Electronic Power Steering ECU**. That experience gave me a “black box” moment: I could measure and validate behavior, but I wanted to understand what was happening inside the chip and why. That curiosity pulled me deeper into IC design and verification.

Around the same time I developed an interest in AI, and over time it became clear that it can help reduce repetitive work and speed up how engineers get from an idea to trustworthy evidence.

### Short timeline

- **TU Dresden (Oct 2022–present):** Master’s program in Nanoelectronic Systems  
- **Infineon (Oct 2024–present):** Digital Functional Verification Intern  
- **Fraunhofer (Mar 2023–Sep 2024):** Student Research Assistant  
- **Bosch (Jan 2018–Jul 2022):** Senior Hardware Engineer  

### Highlights

- **Innovation Award 2025 (Infineon)** — Software and AI Solutions  
- **Innovation Award 2020 (Bosch)** — IoT-based Driver Monitoring  
- Publications: **one IEEE paper published**, one completed conference paper (planned IEEE publication), and one **DVCon US** accepted paper as a coauthor  

### What I’m aiming for next

Over the next 9 months, my first preference is a **PhD** in GenAI for digital design and verification at an esteemed university in the USA or Germany. If that doesn’t align, I’m looking for full-time roles in digital design and verification where I can apply GenAI to real workflows.
